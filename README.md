1. Write a function that accepts the string and a variable
2. Implement a symbolic diff operation:
```
x^3, x // => 3*x^2

x^3, y // => 0

7*x - x^4, x // => 7 - 4*x^3
```
3. Only *, -, + and ^ operations are allowed.
4. There should be a text input(s) on a page to provide
an expression and variable, a button to run the diff function
and a result field or any other result representation.
